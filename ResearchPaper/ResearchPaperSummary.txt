Embedding Encryption and Machine Learning Intrusion Prevention Systems on 
			Programmable Logic Controllers(PLC)

Programmable Logic Controllers(PLC) were made robust to sustain harsh industrial environments, but less priority was given to protect from the potential cyber threats.Major cyber-attacks on PLC can be Categories in 3-types :
1)Interception
2)Injection 
3)Denial of Service(DoS).

There are 2 way to overcome these cyberthreats.
1)Adding a gateway which is expensive and also adds some delay to network which result in its real-time perfomance which affects the responsiveness of SCADA systems.
2)Embed A secure layer in the PLC itself

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the most widely used algorithm in software and hardware to encrypt sensitive data
AES layer stands b/w Network layer and Intrusion Prevention System.it uses Pre-SharedKey(PSK) Scheme

Every data packet received is decrypted by the AES Encryption Layer using the PSK, 
and then sent to the Network Layer for processing. 
the reverse process occurs for sending data packets, as the AES Encryption Layer will encrypt the message using the PSK and then forward the ciphertext to the external network.

The encryption process have five steps:
1)PlainText Division in 128 bits
2)CBC Block Cipher Mode Operation
3)Keyphase Hash: 256 bits key is used 
4)AES-256 Encryption : CBC + keyhash is done by AES-256
5)Message Assembly
 
The decryption process is executing above 5 steps in reverse order.

On top of Encryption 2 features are used for the training of the machine learning algorithm: 
1)packet interarrival time 
2)packet processing time.

by using the above logic,
Embedded encryption module together with the intrusion prevention system makes OpenPLC more secure and immune to major cyber threats and also did not interfere the Real-time characteristics of OpenPLC.
